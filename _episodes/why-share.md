> ## Public health data: Access
> In small groups, try to think of reasons people share code and software.
> Using the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> jot down any ideas you come up with, so that we have an overall list at the end.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - Shared software can be built on by others
> > - Shared code can be checked by others
> > - Shared software can be maintained by others
> > - Extensions to some software have to be shared due to copyleft licensing
> > - It's possible to audit and verify shared software
> > - Sharing software helps you hold yourself to higher coding standards

> ## Public health data: Security
> In the same groups, try to think of reasons people might hesitate to share code or software.
> Again, use the <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>
> to jot down any ideas you come up with.
> > ## Ideas
> > Some reasons that are commonly cited are:
> > - If I share my code, people will find mistakes in it, and that would be embarrassing
> > - My software is badly built, or my code is messy, and it's embarrassing
> > - It takes time to learn how to share and do the sharing -- time I don't have
> > - I don't want to maintain my code or software, and I'd feel obliged to if I shared it
> > - My software won't be as impressive if people can see how it works
> > - People could use adapt my software for purposes I don't agree with
> > - I worked hard on this code and I don't want other people to benefit from my work

> ## Public health data: Anonymization
> Now we have listed some benefits and concerns of sharing, go around your small group and have
> each group member identify two items that they have experience with.
> You can choose a benefit and a concern, or two benefits or even two concerns.
> For each one, share your experience of it with your colleagues.
> If you have time, add a brief note about your experience to the
> <a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>,
> but the focus should be on sharing with your colleagues and listening to what they have to say.
